/* This file contains an example stylesheet for the 
 * HTML output of the c2html tool. 
 *
 * The HTML output generated by c2html has the form:
 *
 * <div class="c2h-code">
 *   <div class="c2h-code-inner">
 *     <table>
 *       <tr>
 *         <td> .. line number .. </td>
 *         <td> .. line code .. </td>
 *       </tr>
 *       .. other lines ..
 *     </table>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * Here's a list of the classes that can be generated
 * and their meaning:
 *
 *                  |
 *   c2h-identifier | Variables
 *                  |
 *      c2h-comment | Comments
 *                  |
 *    c2h-directive | The first keyword of a 
 *                  | preprocessor directive.
 *                  | (the keyword that starts
 *                  | with '#').
 *                  |
 *      c2h-val-str | String listerals. Also the
 *                  | strings between < and >
 *                  | of preprocessor directives
 *                  | are categorized as strings.
 *                  |
 *     c2h-val-char | Char literals (the ones between
 *                  | 's).
 *                  |
 *      c2h-val-int | Integer literals.
 *                  |
 *      c2h-val-flt | Floating point literals.
 *                  |
 *        c2h-kword | All of the language's keywords
 *                  | (typedef, const, int, etc).
 *                  |
 *      c2h-kword-* | Also for the language's
 *                  | keywords, but * is substituted
 *                  | with the keyword (e.g. typedef
 *                  | -> c2h-kword-typedef). This
 *                  | lets you color specific
 *                  | keywords independently.
 *                  |
 *     c2h-operator | Operators (like == and +).
 *                  |
 *    c2h-fdeclname | The name of a function in its
 *                  | declaration.
 *                  |
 *    c2h-fcallname | The name of a function in a
 *                  | function call.
 *                  |
 *
 * Note that the previous class names only apply when
 * the c2h- prefix is used, which is the default in the
 * CLI but not in the C API.
 *
 * Most of the following attributes are merely stylistic,
 * but some are necessary for a correct display of the 
 * code. Read the following comments to know more.
